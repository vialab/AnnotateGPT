00:00.080 --> 00:02.040
Welcome to the study. 

00:02.040 --> 00:05.600
Your task is to evaluate our annotation systems.

00:07.018 --> 00:09.898
There are two tools you can use,

00:09.898 --> 00:12.458
the highlighter and the pen.

00:14.571 --> 00:17.691
You can change the color of the ink by tapping on the palette.

00:20.940 --> 00:25.020
You can annotate the document by placing ink using the digital pen provided.

00:33.115 --> 00:35.275
You can also erase your pen strokes by

00:35.275 --> 00:38.635
using the eraser tip or the side button on the digital pen.

00:00:42.354 --> 00:00:45.954
To use an assistant, you can tap the annotation with your finger.

00:00:47.065 -->  00:00:50.105
The assistance would appear on the left side of the document.

00:00:51.484 --> 00:00:54.444
The system will guess on what the purpose of the annotation is.

00:00:54.444 --> 00:00:59.404
Hovering over the options will give more details about the guesses.

00:01:00.468 --> 00:01:02.568
If you are not satisfied with the options,

00:01:02.568 --> 00:01:05.748
you can type your own purpose using the input provided.

00:01:06.723 --> 00:01:08.883
When tapping an option, the system will

00:01:08.883 --> 00:01:11.603
search for further annotations with the given purpose.

00:01:12.683 --> 00:01:16.503
You can navigate recent annotations using the arrows on the right.

00:01:16.503 --> 00:01:21.323
The system will give further explanation on why the sentence was annotated.

00:01:23.538 --> 00:01:27.138
If the sentence matched the purpose of the annotation, you can accept it.

00:01:29.927 --> 00:01:33.687
If the sentence does not match the purpose, you can reject it as well.

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:42.110
You can also tap the annotation with your finger to navigate the annotations.

00:01:44.386 --> 00:01:46.766
If the annotated sentence does not match the purpose,

00:01:46.766 --> 00:01:50.946
but gave good feedback, you can rate it helpful with the exclamation icon.

00:01:52.061 --> 00:01:55.981
If you need to further annotate the sentence, you can do so by commenting.

00:02:01.569 --> 00:02:03.809
You can continue to annotate the document.

00:02:05.516 --> 00:02:09.496
In this study, you will be grading English test by giving feedback.

00:02:09.496 --> 00:02:13.616
You will also rate each annotation by accepting or rejecting the annotations.

00:02:13.616 --> 00:02:15.356
Here is an example.

00:02:48.737 --> 00:02:51.057
You can now practice the interface yourself.
