00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.540
Welcome to the study.

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:05.600
Your task is to evaluate our annotation systems.

00:00:07.018 --> 00:00:12.658
There are two tools you can use, the highlighter and the pen.

00:00:14.571 --> 00:00:17.691
You can change the color of the ink by tapping on the palette.

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:23.020
You can annotate the document by placing

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:25.020
ink using the digital pen provided.

00:00:33.115 --> 00:00:38.635
You can also erase your pen strokes by using the eraser tip or the side button on the digital pen.

00:00:42.929 --> 00:00:46.496
To use an assistant, you can hover the pen over the annotation.

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:50.529
A tooltip would appear on the right side of the document.

00:00:51.497 --> 00:00:53.737
Tapping on the tooltip would activate it.

00:00:54.949 --> 00:00:59.009
The system will guess on what the purpose of the annotation is.

00:00:59.009 --> 00:01:02.869
Hovering over the options will give more details about the guesses.

00:01:03.933 --> 00:01:05.933
If you are not satisfied with the options,

00:01:05.933 --> 00:01:09.213
you can type your own purpose using the input provided.

00:01:10.851 --> 00:01:13.011
When tapping an option, the system will

00:01:13.011 --> 00:01:15.731
search for further annotations with the given purpose.

00:01:17.755 --> 00:01:22.195
You can navigate recent annotations using the arrows on the left.

00:01:22.195 --> 00:01:26.555
The system will give further explanation on why the sentence was annotated.

00:01:27.776 --> 00:01:31.696
You can also hover over the annotation to navigate the annotations.

00:01:35.082 --> 00:01:38.762
If you are satisfied with the annotation, you can like the annotation.

00:01:42.317 --> 00:01:46.237
If you need to further annotate the sentence, you can do so by commenting.

00:01:48.463 --> 00:01:50.643
If you think the sentence should not be annotated,

00:01:50.643 --> 00:01:53.183
you can reject the annotation as well.

00:01:55.794 --> 00:01:58.034
You can continue to annotate the document.

00:02:01.865 --> 00:02:06.345
Hovering over the tooltip will reveal which pen strokes are associated with it.

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:10.459
You can now practice the interface yourself.
