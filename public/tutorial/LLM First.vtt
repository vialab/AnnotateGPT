00:00.080 --> 00:02.040
Welcome to the study. 

00:02.040 --> 00:05.600
Your task is to evaluate our annotation systems.

00:07.018 --> 00:09.898
There are two tools you can use,

00:09.898 --> 00:12.458
the highlighter and the pen.

00:14.571 --> 00:17.691
You can change the color of the ink by tapping on the palette.

00:20.940 --> 00:25.020
You can annotate the document by placing ink using the digital pen provided.

00:33.115 --> 00:35.275
You can also erase your pen strokes by

00:35.275 --> 00:38.635
using the eraser tip or the side button on the digital pen.

00:42.310 --> 00:45.990
To use an assistant, you can hover the pen over the annotation.

00:47.022 --> 00:49.822
A marker would appear on the left side of the document.

00:51.497 --> 00:53.577
Tapping on the marker would activate it.

00:54.949 --> 00:58.909
The system will guess on what the purpose of the annotation is.

00:58.909 --> 01:02.869
Hovering over the options will give more details about the guesses.

01:03.933 --> 01:06.533
If you are not satisfied with the options,

01:06.533 --> 01:09.213
you can type your own purpose using the input provided.

01:10.851 --> 01:13.011
When tapping an option, the system will

01:13.011 --> 01:15.731
search for further annotations with the given purpose.

01:17.835 --> 01:22.155
You can navigate recent annotations using the arrows on the right.

01:22.155 --> 01:26.475
The system will give further explanation on why the sentence was annotated.

01:29.801 --> 01:33.641
If you are satisfied with the annotation, you can accept the annotation.

01:36.200 --> 01:40.920
If you think the sentence should not be annotated, you can reject the annotation as well.

01:44.073 --> 01:47.993
You can also hover over the annotation to navigate the annotations.

01:50.679 --> 01:53.559
If the annotated sentence does not match the purpose,

01:53.559 --> 01:55.799
but gave good feedback, you can rate it helpful.

01:58.366 --> 02:02.286
If you need to further annotate the sentence, you can do so by commenting.

02:07.884 --> 02:10.124
You can continue to annotate the document.

02:11.853 --> 02:16.173
Hovering over the marker will reveal which pen strokes are associated with it.

02:24.998 --> 02:28.598
In this study, you will be grading English test by giving feedback.

02:28.598 --> 02:30.198
Here is an example.

03:09.624 --> 03:11.944
You can now practice the interface yourself.
