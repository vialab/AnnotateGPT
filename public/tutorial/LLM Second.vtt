00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.520
For your second task, you will be using an assistance tool.

00:00:04.544 --> 00:00:08.144
To use an assistant, you can tap the annotation with your finger.

00:00:09.254 --> 00:00:12.294
The assistance would appear on the left side of the document.

00:00:13.674 --> 00:00:17.134
The system will guess on what the purpose of the annotation is.

00:00:17.134 --> 00:00:21.594
Hovering over the options will give more details about the guesses.

00:00:22.657 --> 00:00:24.757
If you are not satisfied with the options,

00:00:24.757 --> 00:00:27.937
you can type your own purpose using the input provided.

00:00:28.912 --> 00:00:31.072
When tapping an option, the system will

00:00:31.072 --> 00:00:33.792
search for further annotations with the given purpose.

00:00:34.872 --> 00:00:39.192
You can navigate recent annotations using the arrows on the right.

00:00:39.192 --> 00:00:43.512
The system will give further explanation on why the sentence was annotated.

00:00:45.727 --> 00:00:47.967
If you are satisfied with the annotation,

00:00:47.967 --> 00:00:49.567
you can accept the annotation.

00:00:52.116 --> 00:00:54.296
If you think the sentence should not be annotated,

00:00:54.296 --> 00:00:56.836
you can reject the annotation as well.

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:04.299
You can also tap the annotation with your finger to navigate the annotations.

00:01:06.575 --> 00:01:08.955
If the annotated sentence does not match the purpose,

00:01:08.955 --> 00:01:11.695
but gave good feedback, you can rate it helpful.

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.170
If you need to further annotate the sentence, you can do so by commenting.

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.999
You can continue to annotate the document.

00:01:27.705 --> 00:01:31.685
In this study, you will be grading English test by giving feedback.

00:01:31.685 --> 00:01:35.905
You will also rate each annotation by accepting or rejecting the annotations.

00:01:35.905 --> 00:01:37.545
Here is an example.

00:02:10.927 --> 00:02:13.247
You can now practice the interface yourself.
