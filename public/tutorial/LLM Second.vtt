For your second task, you will be using an assistance tool.

00:00:06.049 --> 00:00:09.616
To use an assistant, you can hover the pen over the annotation.

00:00:10.689 --> 00:00:12.729
A tooltip would appear on the right side of the document.

00:00:14.617 --> 00:00:16.857
Tapping on the tooltip would activate it.

00:00:18.062 --> 00:00:22.122
The system will guess on what the purpose of the annotation is.

00:00:22.122 --> 00:00:25.982
Hovering over the options will give more details about the guesses.

00:00:27.046 --> 00:00:29.046
If you are not satisfied with the options,

00:00:29.046 --> 00:00:32.326
you can type your own purpose using the input provided.

00:00:33.957 --> 00:00:36.117
When tapping an option, the system will

00:00:36.117 --> 00:00:38.837
search for further annotations with the given purpose.

00:00:40.857 --> 00:00:45.297
You can navigate recent annotations using the arrows on the left.

00:00:45.297 --> 00:00:49.657
The system will give further explanation on why the sentence was annotated.

00:00:50.874 --> 00:00:54.794
You can also hover over the annotation to navigate the annotations.

00:00:58.176 --> 00:01:01.856
If you are satisfied with the annotation, you can like the annotation.

00:01:05.406 --> 00:01:09.326
If you need to further annotate the sentence, you can do so by commenting.

00:01:11.548 --> 00:01:13.728
If you think the sentence should not be annotated,

00:01:13.728 --> 00:01:16.268
you can reject the annotation as well.

00:01:18.874 --> 00:01:21.114
You can continue to annotate the document.

00:01:24.941 --> 00:01:29.421
Hovering over the tool tip will reveal  which pen strokes are associated with it.

00:01:31.211 --> 00:01:33.531
You can now practice the interface yourself.
