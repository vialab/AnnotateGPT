00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.520
For your second task, you will be using an assistance tool.

00:00:05.934 --> 00:00:09.501
To use an assistant, you can hover the pen over the annotation.

00:00:10.574 --> 00:00:13.534
A tooltip would appear on the right side of the document.

00:00:14.502 --> 00:00:16.742
Tapping on the tooltip would activate it.

00:00:17.954 --> 00:00:21.914
The system will guess on what the purpose of the annotation is. 

00:00:21.914 --> 00:00:25.874
Hovering over the options will give more details about the guesses.

00:00:26.938 --> 00:00:29.238
If you are not satisfied with the options, 

00:00:29.238 --> 00:00:32.218
you can type your own purpose using the input provided.

00:00:33.856 --> 00:00:36.016
When tapping an option, the system will

00:00:36.016 --> 00:00:40.760 
search for further annotations with the given purpose.

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:45.200
You can navigate recent annotations using the arrows on the left.

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:50.781
The system will give further explanation on why the sentence was annotated.

00:00:53.461 --> 00:00:57.381
You can also hover over the annotation to navigate the annotations.

00:01:00.767 --> 00:01:04.447
If you are satisfied with the annotation, you can like the annotation.

00:01:08.001 --> 00:01:11.921
If you need to further annotate the sentence, you can do so by commenting.

00:01:14.147 --> 00:01:16.827
If you think the sentence should not be annotated,

00:01:16.827 --> 00:01:18.867
you can reject the annotation as well.

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:23.910
You can now practice the interface yourself.
