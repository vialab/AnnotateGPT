Welcome to the study.

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:05.600
Your task is to evaluate our annotation systems.

00:00:07.018 --> 00:00:12.658
There are two tools you can use, the highlighter and the pen.

00:00:14.571 --> 00:00:17.691
You can change the color of the ink by tapping on the palette.

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:23.020
You can annotate the document by placing

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:25.020
ink using the digital pen provided.

00:00:33.115 --> 00:00:38.635
You can also erase your pen strokes by using the eraser tip or the side button on the digital pen.

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:43.496
You can now practice the interface yourself.
